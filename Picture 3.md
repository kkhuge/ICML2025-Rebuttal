**Picture 3: Test loss and accuracy of FedAvg and centralized learning for the CNN32 model trained on the non-IID CIFAR-10 dataset using the cross-entropy loss function.** $\eta_0 = 0.001$, $\sigma_{W} = 1.5$, $\sigma_{b}=0.1$. SGD is employed for both centralized learning and FedAvg. Each global round of FedAvg consists of $\tau = 5$ SGD iterations.
